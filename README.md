dEmail
======

The goal of this quick project is to automatically send out a results email after every NASCAR practice session. It will eventually be a web app that lets you select which team or driver to focus on, but the drivers will be hardcoded in the beginning and there won't be a web interface until the core functionality is completed.

**Checkpoints in the Project:**
- Create html template using antworts guidelines 
- Use node.js to grab data from Nascar's XML feed.
- Dynamically modify the html based on the XML data.
- Use nodemailer to mail the email to a single person for final review before forwarding it out.

**Currently Working On:** Creating html template.
